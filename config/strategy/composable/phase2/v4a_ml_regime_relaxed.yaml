# Phase 3 Tuned Config: v4a ML + Relaxed Regime (EV still tandlös)
# Goal: Isolate RegimeFilter tuning effect before EVGate tuning
#
# Changes from v3:
#   - RegimeFilter: Add "bear" and "ranging" (all regimes allowed)
#     Target: Reduce veto rate from 80.7% to ~40-60%
#   - EVGate: Keep min_ev=0.0 (tandlös, for comparison)
#   - Cooldown: Unchanged

components:
  - type: ml_confidence
    params:
      threshold: 0.24  # Baseline threshold (unchanged)

  - type: regime_filter
    params:
      allowed_regimes: ["trending", "bull", "balanced", "bear", "ranging"]
      # TUNED: All regimes allowed (vs v3: only trending/bull/balanced)
      # This isolates the regime filter tuning effect

  - type: ev_gate
    params:
      min_ev: 0.0  # UNCHANGED: Still tandlös (for incremental analysis)

  - type: cooldown
    params:
      min_bars_between_trades: 24  # 24 hours for 1h timeframe (unchanged)

# Test period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-31 (Q1 2024)
#
# Expected behavior:
#   - Incremental test: v3 → v4a shows pure regime filter relaxation effect
#   - Trade count: target 5-15 (more than v3: 1, less than v0: 18)
#   - RegimeFilter veto_rate: target ~40-60% (vs v3: 80.7%)
#   - EVGate veto_rate: still 0% (tandlös)
#
# Analysis value:
#   Compare v3 → v4a → v4 to separate:
#   - RegimeFilter tuning impact (v3 → v4a)
#   - EVGate tuning impact (v4a → v4)
