# Optimization Run Summary: optuna_phase3_fine_v7_50

**Run ID:** `run_20251208_140048`
**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Trials:** 50

## Overview

This 50-trial run was conducted to verify the fix for the "Identical Results" bug and to explore the parameter space for Phase 3 Fine Tuning.

**Status:** ✅ Bug Fixed (Results vary significantly based on parameters).
**Performance:** ⚠️ High Zero-Trade Rate (90%) and Negative Returns on active trials.

## Key Findings

1.  **Sensitivity:** The strategy is extremely sensitive to `entry_conf_overall` and `signal_adaptation` zones.

    - **Low Thresholds (< 0.25):** Resulted in massive trade volume (2500+ trades) but consistent losses (PF ~0.92).
    - **High Thresholds (> 0.30):** Resulted in 0 trades.
    - **Middle Ground:** Trial 1 (0.29) produced 453 trades but still had a PF of 0.92.

2.  **Profit Factor:** None of the active trials achieved a Profit Factor > 1.0. The strategy is consistently losing slightly on trades, likely due to fees/slippage or lack of edge in the current configuration.

3.  **Zero Trades:** 45 out of 50 trials produced 0 trades. This indicates that the search space for `entry_conf_overall` and `zones` was mostly too high for the current market conditions or other filters (Fib gates).

## Top Trials (by Score)

| Trial      | Score   | Trades | PF   | Return | Entry Conf | Low Zone | Mid Zone |
| :--------- | :------ | :----- | :--- | :----- | :--------- | :------- | :------- |
| **001**    | -100.09 | 453    | 0.93 | -4.2%  | 0.29       | 0.26     | 0.30     |
| **005**    | -100.43 | 2528   | 0.92 | -27.8% | 0.19       | 0.23     | 0.33     |
| **Others** | -250.20 | 0      | 0.00 | 0.0%   | >0.30      | >0.28    | >0.35    |

## Recommendations

1.  **Narrow Search Space:** Focus `entry_conf_overall` strictly between **0.24 and 0.30**.
2.  **Improve Quality:** The current logic loses money even when it trades. We need to:
    - Tighten **Regime Filters** (require higher `regime_proba`).
    - Optimize **Exits** (trailing stop, max hold) to cut losses earlier.
    - Review **Risk Map** to ensure we aren't betting too big on low-confidence setups.
3.  **Next Run:** Launch a focused 100-trial run with these narrower constraints.
