# Phase 3 Isolation Test: v4a WITHOUT Cooldown
# Goal: Isolate CooldownComponent anomaly (1871 vetoes with 0 trades)
#
# Hypothesis: Removing cooldown should restore expected behavior
# Expected: If RegimeFilter is truly relaxed, should see more allowed entries

components:
  - type: ml_confidence
    params:
      threshold: 0.24  # Baseline threshold

  - type: regime_filter
    params:
      allowed_regimes: ["trending", "bull", "balanced", "bear", "ranging"]
      # All regimes allowed (relaxed from v3)

  - type: ev_gate
    params:
      min_ev: 0.0  # Tandlös (for isolation)

  # REMOVED: cooldown component to isolate its anomalous veto behavior

# Test period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-31 (Q1 2024)
#
# Expected behavior:
#   - If cooldown was the blocker: trades > 0
#   - If another issue: trades still 0
#   - Allowed rate should increase vs v4a (170 allowed)
#
# Success criteria:
#   1. Trades > 0 (proves cooldown was blocker)
#   2. Attribution shows no cooldown vetoes
#   3. Allowed > 170 (from v4a)
