# Phase 2 Functional Proof: EVGate with min_ev=0.2
# Purpose: Prove EVGate CAN veto when threshold is meaningful (NOT tuning)

components:
  - type: ml_confidence
    params:
      threshold: 0.24  # Baseline threshold

  - type: regime_filter
    params:
      allowed_regimes: ["trending", "bull", "balanced"]

  - type: ev_gate
    params:
      min_ev: 0.2  # Functional proof: require EV > 0.2

# Test period: 2024-06-01 to 2024-08-01 (same as v0/v1/v2)
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
#   1. EV veto_rate > 0 (proves EVGate can filter)
#   2. Decision count == 1345 (invariant still true)
#   3. Regime veto_count == 1227 (unchanged)
#
# After this: FREEZE EVGate in Phase 2 (no more EV formula iteration)
