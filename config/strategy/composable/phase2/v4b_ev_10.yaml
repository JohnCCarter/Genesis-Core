# Phase 3 EVGate Calibration: v4b min_ev=0.10 (~20% target veto)
# Goal: Calibrate EVGate with p80 threshold
#
# Changes from v4a:
#   - EVGate: min_ev=0.10 (target ~20% veto, p80 of EV distribution)
#   - RegimeFilter: Keep relaxed (all regimes)
#   - Cooldown: Keep min_bars=24 (unchanged)

components:
  - type: ml_confidence
    params:
      threshold: 0.24  # Baseline threshold (unchanged)

  - type: regime_filter
    params:
      allowed_regimes: ["trending", "bull", "balanced", "bear", "ranging"]
      # Keep relaxed (all regimes allowed)

  - type: ev_gate
    params:
      min_ev: 0.10  # TUNED: p80 threshold (~20% veto target)

  - type: cooldown
    params:
      min_bars_between_trades: 24  # 24 hours for 1h timeframe (unchanged)

# Test period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-31 (Q1 2024)
#
# Expected behavior:
#   - EVGate veto_rate: target ~20% (p80 of EV distribution)
#   - CooldownComponent veto_rate: ~17% (from v4a baseline)
#   - Trade count: target 8-12 (moderately filtered vs v4a: 15)
#
# Analysis value:
#   - Calibrate EVGate impact on trade count
#   - Measure veto rate vs EV distribution percentile
#   - Recommended threshold based on previous analysis (p80)
