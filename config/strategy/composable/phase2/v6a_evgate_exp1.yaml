# Phase 3 Milestone 4 - Experiment 4.1: EVGate Quality Tuning
# Goal: Improve PF via EVGate filtering without sacrificing robustness
#
# Single change from v5a (sizing baseline):
#   - EVGate: min_ev 0.0 → 0.05 (careful threshold, target ~15-25% veto rate)
#
# All other settings unchanged from v5a:
#   - risk.risk_map: [0.53, ...] (locked from Milestone 3)
#   - Components: ml_confidence (0.24), all regimes, Cooldown (24)
#
# Hypothesis:
#   - Filter out bottom ~20% of signals by EV
#   - Expected: 413 → ~330 trades (20% reduction)
#   - Expected: PF 1.45 → 1.50+ (quality improvement)
#   - Guard: PF utan top-3 must stay >= 1.25

# Experiment 4.1 hypothesis:
#   - EVGate veto rate: ~15-25% of component-allowed signals
#   - Trade count: 413 → ~330 (20% reduction)
#   - PF improvement: 1.45 → 1.50+ (better edge per trade)
#   - Robustness guard: PF utan top-3 >= 1.25 (maintain buffer)
#   - Concentration guard: top-1 < 30% (maintain diversification)
