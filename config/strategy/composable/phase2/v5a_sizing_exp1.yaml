# Phase 3 Milestone 3 - Experiment 3.1: Sizing Policy Tuning
# Goal: Increase trade frequency via risk_map adjustment (config-only)
#
# Single change from v4a:
#   - risk.risk_map: Lower first threshold 0.6 → 0.53 (careful reduction)
#     Target: More signals qualify for non-zero size
#
# All other settings unchanged from v4a baseline:
#   - Components: ml_confidence (0.24), all regimes, EVGate (0.0), Cooldown (24)
#   - No changes to ATR zones, rounding, or other sizing params

components:
  - type: ml_confidence
    params:
      threshold: 0.24  # Unchanged from v4a

  - type: regime_filter
    params:
      allowed_regimes: ["trending", "bull", "balanced", "bear", "ranging"]
      # Unchanged: All regimes allowed

  - type: ev_gate
    params:
      min_ev: 0.0  # Unchanged: Still permissive

  - type: cooldown
    params:
      min_bars_between_trades: 24  # Unchanged: 24 hours for 1h timeframe

# NEW: Explicit risk_map override (default was [0.6, 0.005], ...)
risk:
  risk_map:
    - [0.53, 0.005]  # TUNED: Lower first threshold (was 0.6)
    - [0.7, 0.008]   # Unchanged
    - [0.8, 0.01]    # Unchanged
    - [0.9, 0.012]   # Unchanged
  risk_cap_pct: 0.012  # Unchanged
  symbol_portfolio_cap_pct: 0.025  # Unchanged

# Experiment 3.1 hypothesis:
#   - Lower confidence threshold → more signals qualify for sizing
#   - Expected: Increase from 63 → ~80-100 trades/year
#   - Expected: Improve PF robustness (PF without top-3 >= 1.2)
#   - Risk: Must maintain PF quality and MaxDD sanity
