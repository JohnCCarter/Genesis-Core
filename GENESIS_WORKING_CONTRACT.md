# GENESIS_WORKING_CONTRACT.md

> Working anchor for day-start and resumed sessions.
> This file is **not SSOT** and must not override repo governance documents.

## Purpose

This file exists to prevent session drift.
Before starting new work, the agent should re-anchor against the latest validated lane, known blockers, and next admissible step.

## Non-purpose

This file does **not**:

- authorize new implementation work by itself
- grant execution authority by itself
- override `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/governance_mode.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or explicit user instructions
- replace packets, reports, or verified evidence artifacts

## Authority order

1. Explicit user request for the current task
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. `docs/governance_mode.md`
4. `docs/OPUS_46_GOVERNANCE.md`
5. `AGENTS.md`
6. This file (`GENESIS_WORKING_CONTRACT.md`)

## Current branch and mode anchor

- Branch: `feature/ri-role-map-implementation-2026-03-24`
- Expected mode on this branch: `RESEARCH`
- RESEARCH allows the smallest reproducible, traceable step
- RESEARCH does **not** authorize drift into strict-only surfaces, runtime-default authority, promotion, or champion claims without the required lane/packet

## Core conceptual lock

Genesis must be treated as a **deterministic policy-selection system**.
It is **not** an adaptive system.
It selects among predefined policies based on observable state, and any switching must remain exact, traceable, and reproducible.

## Current validated lane

Active focus right now:

- the bounded RI router replay counterfactual lane is closed as an explanatory research lane
- the current verified conclusion is that defensive starvation is better localized to raw defensive mandate assignment than to generic hysteresis or min-dwell semantics
- keep the current move on docs / report / packet interpretation surfaces only unless a fresh follow-up packet is explicitly opened

## Explicitly not active by default

Unless the user reopens them explicitly with the needed authority, do **not** treat these as active:

- the earlier `3h` historical validation lane from the prior working anchor
- inherited runtime/integration authority from RI research docs
- runtime-default changes
- paper-shadow follow-up fixes
- promotion/champion claims from isolated research evidence

## Key anchors already verified

- `docs/governance/concept_evidence_runtime_lane_model_2026-04-23.md` is the canonical practical definition of concept / research-evidence / runtime-integration lanes
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already says to prefer the cheapest admissible lane before proposing durable runtime structure
- `docs/OPUS_46_GOVERNANCE.md` treats lane classification as workflow framing, not new authority
- `docs/governance/ri_router_replay_evidence_slice_precode_packet_2026-04-23.md` freezes the first fresh RI router replay subject without granting execution authority
- `scripts/analyze/scpe_ri_v1_router_replay.py` and `results/research/scpe_v1_ri/` exist as tracked historical reference surfaces, not inherited authority for the fresh slice
- `docs/governance/ri_router_replay_counterfactual_closeout_report_2026-04-23.md` closes the bounded counterfactual lane and records the current blocker ordering without granting semantics or runtime approval

## Last verified facts relevant to today

- the fresh pre-code RI replay packet already freezes the allowed future input/output envelope and explicit non-inheritance rule
- the frozen Phase C evidence inputs exist locally under `results/research/ri_advisory_environment_fit/phase3_phasec_evidence_capture_v2_2026-04-17/`
- the historical SCPE replay script and approved eight-file replay root exist locally as comparison/reference context only
- the baseline fresh replay surface still shows raw defensive `30` versus selected defensive `3`
- `switch_threshold: 2 -> 1` and `defensive_transition_state mandate/confidence: 1 -> 2` are behavior-equivalent on the current frozen surface
- `min_dwell: 3 -> 1` increases continuation dominance rather than improving defensive separation
- `hysteresis: 1 -> 0` is a no-op on the baseline surface, and the apparent hysteresis blocker reduces to raw mandate `1` versus continuation mandate `2/3`

## Next admissible steps

Choose the smallest valid next step that matches the user request:

1. stop at the current closeout if the user only wanted a bounded research conclusion and tracked anchor
2. if more evidence is explicitly requested, open one fresh semantics-focused research packet for evaluating whether `defensive_transition_state` should be treated as a mandate-2 candidate on research surfaces only
3. keep any future follow-up isolated from `src/**`, `config/**`, runtime-default authority, family-rule surfaces, and promotion/readiness semantics unless a new lane is explicitly approved

## Hard stops

Stop and re-anchor before proceeding if any of the following happens:

- the next step starts relying on memory instead of cited anchors
- concept or research language starts implying runtime/family/authority status
- runtime/paper work starts to creep in without explicit authority
- a task touches strict-only surfaces or champion/promotion semantics
- the lane is no longer obvious from the latest user request

## Required day-start / resume ritual

At the start of a new day or resumed session, do this before reasoning forward:

1. read this file
2. read persistent user memory relevant to workflow
3. read current repo memory items relevant to the active lane
4. identify the latest validated lane and the latest non-active lanes
5. state the next smallest admissible step before making claims

## Update rule

Update this file only when one of these changes:

- active lane
- blocked/not-active lane status
- known verified blocker
- next admissible action

Keep it short. If detail is needed, point to the authoritative doc instead of copying it here.
